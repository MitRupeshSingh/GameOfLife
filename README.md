# GameOfLife


This project is easy to run as it does not have any dependencies.
Just run the project or main class(GameOfLife.java).

It is a popular Game Of Life project where we have a single class to perform all the operations.

Input from the user is taken in the form as:
...O.O
OOOO..

where . is dead cell and O is live cell.

It takes the entire string and convert it into array.
By taking each character of the string we find its live and dead neighbors and decide its state.

Finally, we have included GameOfLifeTest file too.
